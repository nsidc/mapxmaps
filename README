NSIDC Map and Grid Library

This directory contains a collection of Map Projection Parameters (.mpp)
and Grid Parameter Definition (.gpd) files that are used in conjunction
with the mapping and gridding software (the mapx library and its
application programs) at NSIDC.  

See http://cires.colorado.edu/~knowlesk/ppgc.html for background on the
software.  

See http://nsidc.org/data/tools/mapx/ for the latest news and software
distribution.

Users of the mapx library and its application programs can set the local path
to these files the environment variable PATHMPP.  For example, in
C shell, 

setenv PATHMPP ~/lib/maps:/my/other/path

(n.b. PATHGPD is obsolete, all routines now search PATHMPP only)

There are two types of mpp/gpd files.  Files in this directory are
supported files.  Supported files describe data sets that NSIDC
distributes, and enjoy a higher level of support than the others.
Unsupported files (in the subdirectory called "unsupported") are used for
miscellanous (possibly research only) data sets, and may be promoted to
the supported level in the event that they are used for a distributed data
set.  Unsupported files also include files that we have written for data
we may have used at one time or another, for example, the ncep.gpd files,
and think that they might be useful to someone else who wants to use the
mapx library and applications to do something similar.

This library of mpp/gpd files has accumulated over a number of years and
various projects at NSIDC, and unfortunately suffers from a lack of naming
convention.

Guidelines to consider when defining new EASE-Grid gpds:

Full hemisphere Azimuthal grids:

Keep the math simple wrt an existing grid.  If the new grid is X times the old
resolution, then make the coordinates multiply by X.  Examples:
N50 = Nl/2 = Nh/4 = N10/5 = N5/10.  Ensure that the equator is properly
included in the sampled coverage of the new grid (the samples being the
centers of the edge cells).  

Global grids:

1) Areal coverage:

   a) Should never have overlap in the horizontal dimension, i.e. the
   longitude of the left edge should be exactly equal to the longitude of the
   right edge

   b) Cannot (by definition) extend beyond the poles in the vertical
   dimension.  Depending on the cell size, this will probably mean that the
   poles will not be covered.  (If you care that much, you should probably be
   using an azimuthal grid, anyway.)

2) Refer to rules for azimuthal grids wrt nesting cells in another existing
   grid.
