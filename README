NSIDC Map and Grid Library

This directory contains a collection of Map Projection Parameters (.mpp)
and Grid Parameter Definition (.gpd) files that are used in conjunction
with the mapping and gridding software (the mapx library and its
application programs) at NSIDC.  

See http://cires.colorado.edu/~knowlesk/ppgc.html for background on the
software.  

See http://nsidc.org/data/tools/mapx/ for the latest news and software
distribution.

Users of the mapx library and its application programs can set the local path
to these files via environment variables PATHMPP and PATHGPD.  For example, in
C shell, 

setenv PATHMPP ~/lib/maps:/my/other/path
setenv PATHGPD $PATHMPP

There are two types of mpp/gpd files.  Supported files describe data sets that
NSIDC distributes, and enjoy a higher level of support than the others.
Unsupported files are used for miscellanous (possibly research only) data
sets, and may be promoted to the supported level in the event that they are
used for a distributed data set.  Unsupported files also include files that we
have written for data we may have used at one time or another, for example,
the ncep.gpd files, and think that they might be useful to someone else who
wants to use the mapx library and applications to do something similar.

This library of mpp/gpd files has accumulated over a number of years and
various projects at NSIDC, and unfortunately suffers from a lack of naming
convention.
