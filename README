NSIDC Map and Grid Library

This directory contains a collection of Map Projection Parameters (.mpp)
and Grid Parameter Definition (.gpd) files that are used in conjunction
with the mapping and gridding software (the mapx library and its
application programs) at NSIDC.  

See http://cires.colorado.edu/~knowlesk/ppgc.html for background on the
software.  

See ftp://baikal.colorado.edu/pub/NSIDC/maps.tar.gz for the software
distribution.

There are two types of mpp/gpd files, supported files describe data sets
that NSIDC distributes, and enjoy a higher level of support than the
others.  Unsupported files are used for miscellanous (probably research
only) data sets, and may be promoted to the supported level in the event
that they are used for a distributed data set 

Supported mpp/gpd files:
------------------------

M200correct.mpp - 200 km scale Global Cylindrical EASE-Grid mpp.  All
		  supported EASE-Grid global gpds must refer to this mpp

Ml.gpd		- 25 km Global Cylindrical EASE-Grid

Mh.gpd		- 12.5 km Global Cylindrical EASE-Grid

N200correct.mpp - 200 km scale Northern Hemisphere EASE-Grid mpp.  All
		  supported EASE-Grid No. Hem. gpds must refer to this mpp

Nl.gpd		- 25 km No. Hem. EASE-Grid

Nh.gpd		- 12.5 km No. Hem. EASE-Grid

S200correct.mpp - 200 km scale Southern Hemisphere EASE-Grid mpp.  All
		  supported EASE-Grid So. Hem. gpds must refer to this mpp

Sl.gpd		- 25 km So. Hem. EASE-Grid

Sh.gpd		- 12.5 km So. Hem. EASE-Grid


Unsupported mpp/gpd files:
--------------------------

M50.gpd         - 50 km Global Cylindrical EASE-Grid, used to produce 25 
		  and 12.5 km EASE-Grid data

N50.gpd		- 50 km No. Hem. EASE-Grid, used to produce 25 and 12.5 km
		  EASE-Grid data
