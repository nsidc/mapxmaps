NSIDC Map and Grid Library

This directory contains a collection of Map Projection Parameters (.mpp)
and Grid Parameter Definition (.gpd) files that are used in conjunction
with the mapping and gridding software (the mapx library and its
application programs) at NSIDC.  

See http://cires.colorado.edu/~knowlesk/ppgc.html for background on the
software.  

See http://nsidc.org/data/tools/mapx/ for the latest news and software
distribution.

Users of the mapx library and its application programs can set the local path
to these files via environment variables PATHMPP and PATHGPD.  For example, in
C shell, 

setenv PATHMPP ~/lib/maps:/my/other/path
setenv PATHGPD $PATHMPP

There are two types of mpp/gpd files.  Supported files describe data sets that
NSIDC distributes, and enjoy a higher level of support than the others.
Unsupported files are used for miscellanous (possibly research only) data
sets, and may be promoted to the supported level in the event that they are
used for a distributed data set.  Unsupported files also include files that we
have written for data we may have used at one time or another, for example,
the ncep.gpd files, and think that they might be useful to someone else who
wants to use the mapx library and applications to do something similar.

This library of mpp/gpd files has accumulated over a number of years and
various projects at NSIDC, and unfortunately suffers from a lack of naming
convention.

Guidelines to consider when defining new EASE-Grid gpds:

Full hemisphere Azimuthal grids:

1) Areal coverage: Whenever possible, relate grids by maintaining the same
areal coverage as an existing grid, e.g. the 25 and 5 km No. Hem. grids
(Nl.gpd and N5.gpd) cover the exact same area.

2) Cell alignment: 

   a) When a higher resolution grid is an odd divisor of another (5 is odd,
   dividing 25 5 times) note that the result is nested and bore-centered, by
   definition.  This makes the alignment decision easy.

   b) However, when a new, even-numbered division is being defined, e.g. 12.5
   km from 25 km, or 5 km from 10 km, you may choose to bore-center or nest
   the grids.  If you choose to bore-center the grids, (e.g. Nh bore-centered
   with Nl, or N5 bore-centered with N10), arrange for the cell containing the
   Pole to be a bore-centered location.  In this case, note that the areal
   coverage will never be the same, so choose a coverage that properly
   contains (in the mathematical sense) the equator.  For purposes of cell
   index multiples, you may choose to include more than the equator, but be
   sure to include at least the equator.

Global grids:

1) Areal coverage:

   a) Should never have overlap in the horizontal dimension, i.e. the
   longitude of the left edge should be exactly equal to the longitude of the
   right edge

   b) Cannot (by definition) extend beyond the poles in the vertical
   dimension.  Depending on the cell size, this will probably mean that the
   poles will not be covered.  (If you care that much, you should probably be
   using an azimuthal grid, anyway.)

2) Refer to rules for azimuthal grids wrt nesting cells in another existing
   grid.
