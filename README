NSIDC Map and Grid Definition Files

This directory contains a collection of Map Projection Parameters (.mpp)
and Grid Parameter Definition (.gpd) files that are used with mapping and
gridding software (the mapx library and its application programs) at
NSIDC.

See http://geospatialmethods.org/documents/ppgc.html for background on the
software.  

See http://geospatialmethods.org/mapx/ for the latest news and software
distribution.

These files can be installed anywhere on your local system.  If you are
installing from a tarball, it will create a subdirectory called
"nsidc_maps" in the directory where you extract the tarball.

The mapx library and its application programs use the environment variable
PATHMPP to search for .mpp/.gpd files.  PATHMPP can contain a list of
directories that will be searched in order.  For example, if you have
untarred these files in your home directory, and you have your own local
.mpp files in /my/other/path/, then, in C shell, you should specify

setenv PATHMPP ~/nsidc_maps:/my/other/path

(N.B. For long-time users of the mapx library: PATHGPD is obsolete, all
routines now search PATHMPP only.)

There are two types of mpp/gpd files.  Files in the top nsidc_maps
directory are supported files.  Supported files describe data sets that
NSIDC distributes, and enjoy a higher level of support than the others.
Unsupported files (in the subdirectory called "unsupported") are used for
miscellaneous (possibly research only) data sets, and may be promoted to
the supported level in the event that they are used for a distributed data
set.  Unsupported files also include files that we have written for data
we may have used at one time or another, for example, the ncep.gpd files,
and think that they might be useful to someone else who wants to use the
mapx library and applications to do something similar.

If you wish to use the unsupported .mpp/.gpd files, remember to add the
nsidc_maps/unsupported subdirectory to the list of directories in your
PATHMPP.

This collection of mpp/gpd files has accumulated over a number of years
and various projects at NSIDC, and unfortunately suffers from a lack of
naming convention.

Supported EASE-Grid mpp/gpd files:
---------------------------------

EASE2_Xyykm.gpd - Families of EASE-Grid-2.0 definitions, which use the
                  WGS84 ellipsoid instead of the spherical Earth model
                  used in the original EASE-Grids.  These grid definitions
                  make file distribution to/from geotiff format and GIS
                  tools much easier than the original definitions.  For
		  these grids:
		  X : N = Northern Lambert Azimuthal Equal-Area
		      S = Southern Lambert Azimuthal Equal-Area
		      M = Cylindrical Equal-Area
		  and
		  yy : grid resolution, in km (can include optional
		       decimal point, e.g. '12.5'
		  The 25/12.5/6.25 km grids are nested (exactly 4 of each
		  12.5-kilometer cells in each 25-kilometer cell, etc)

		  The SMAP (Soil Moisture Active-Passive) grids (36/9/3/1
		  km) are nested (exact multiples of each successively
		  finer resolution grid cells in each coarser resolution
		  grid).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Guidelines to consider when defining new EASE-Grid gpds:

Use the new format (parameter:value, all in the .gpd, no separate .mpp
file).  It's easier to read and maintain.

Keep units in meters.  Although mapx can handle other units, other units
can cause confusion in the utilities like xytest.  For clean ways to nest
grids inside existing grids, see examples like Moa125.gpd and Grn250m.gpd.

Full hemisphere Azimuthal grids:

Keep the math simple wrt an existing grid.  If the new grid is X times the old
resolution, then make the coordinates multiply by X.  Examples:
N50 = Nl/2 = Nh/4 = N10/5 = N5/10.

The original rule for EASE-Grids was to ensure that the equator was
properly included in the sampled coverage of the new grid (the samples
being the centers of the edge cells); however, this caused problems with
grid corner cells "wrapping" around the opposite pole.  The EASE-Grid-2.0
recommendation is to avoid this situation by placing the equator exactly
at or outside the edge cells.  The original EASE-Grid defined the pole at
the center of an odd number of grid cells (e.g. Nl.gpd used 721 x 721);
EASE-Grid 2.0 places the pole at the intersection of the center 4 cells,
in an even-numbered grid (e.g. EASE2_N25km.gpd uses 720 x 720).

The original EASE-Grid used a spherical Earth model, with R=6371.228 km.
Distances in the original mpp/gpd files were in km.

EASE-Grid-2.0 uses the WGS84 ellipsoid.  Keep the distances in meters.  

Global grids:

1) Areal coverage:

   a) Should never have overlap in the horizontal dimension, i.e. the
   longitude of the left edge should be exactly equal to the longitude of the
   right edge

   b) Cannot (by definition) extend beyond the poles in the vertical
   dimension.  Depending on the cell size, this will probably mean that the
   poles will not be covered.  (If you care that much, you should probably be
   using an azimuthal grid, anyway.)

2) Refer to rules for azimuthal grids wrt nesting cells in another existing
   grid.
